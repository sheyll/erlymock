<h1>ErlyMock - An EasyMock inspired mocking library.</h1>
<p>Copyright © 2011, 2012, 2013 Sven Heyll</p>
<p><b>Version:</b> 5.0.0</p>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sven Heyll (<a href="mailto:sven.heyll@gmail.com"><tt>sven.heyll@gmail.com</tt></a>).</p>


<p> ErlyMock was built to be helpful for Test Driven Development. I know this
goal is by no means yet reached, so I ask you kindly to support this
project. All suggestions, complaints and improvements are welcome. </p>

<p>
ErlyMock is the latest incarnation of an Erlang mocking library inspired by
Easymock for Java. It is used in unit tests to verify that a set of functions is
called by the code under test in correct order and with correct parameters.
</p>
<p>
With ErlyMock it is possible to declare the behavior of arbitrary
modules/functions with or without expecting acutal invocations. The user simply
declares what each function call to some function should return or do at the
beginning of a unit test.
</p>
<h2>Some features:</h2>
<ul>
<li>API documentation</li>
<li>battle proven in at least three large projects at http://www.lindenbaum.eu</li>
<li>comprehensive runtime messages</li>
<li>two-letter module name(we went from 'mock' to 'em', which was quite an improvement for us)</li>
<li>small, flexible and easy to use API</li>
<li>allows strict expectations</li>
<li>allows stub behavior definitions to be intuitively mixed with strict expectations</li>
<li>correctly restores cover compiled module</li>
<li>automatic cleanup when mock or test process dies</li>
<li>implemented with OTP standard behaviour</li>
<li>rebar enabled</li></ul>

<h2>Usage example:</h2>

<p>Assume there are two modules, used by the code to be tested, that shall be mocked (at least to prevent damaging side effects):</p>

A rocket launcher server:
<pre>
-module(rocket_launcher).

launch(Longitude, Latitude, Type) -&gt;
 ....
</pre>
And A UI module:
<pre>
-module(rocket_launcher_ui).

ask_for_instructions() -&gt;
 ...
</pre>
Then this is how a happy case unit test might look like:
<pre>
launche_missle_test() -&gt;
   % create a new mock process
   M = em:new(),

   % define the expectations
   em:strict(M, rocket_launcher_ui, ask_for_instructions, [],
            {return, [{longitude, 123},
                      {latitude, 999},
                      {type, some_rocket_type}]}),
   em:strict(M, missle_lauchner, launch, [123, 999, some_rocket_type]),

   % tell the mock that all expectations are defined
   em:replay(M),

   % run code under test
   rocket_app:interactive(),

   % verify expectations immediately
   em:verify(M).
</pre>

<p>Another example shall show the usefulness of <a href="em.html#await_expectations-1"><code>em:await_expectations/1</code></a>
instead of <a href="em.html#verify-1"><code>em:verify/1</code></a> to wait for asynchronous invokations and <a href="em.html#zelf-1"><code>em:zelf/1</code></a> as argument matcher matching the process id of the process calling
the mocked functions in the replay phase.</p>

<pre>

%% Let's look at the impl first:
-module(xxx_impl).



download_image(Url) -&gt;
    gen_server:cast(?MODULE, {download, URL}).

%% ...

handle_cast({download, URL}, State) -&gt;
    net_io:schedule_download(Url, self()),
    {noreply, State}.

%%%%%%%%%% Now this 'cast' happens asynchronously using 'em:verify/1' would not
%%%%%%%%%% help a lot, it would be pure luck if the erlang scheduler executed
%%%%%%%%%% that handle_cast before. This is the case where
%%%%%%%%%% em:await_expectations/1 comes in handy...

%% Let's look at the test first:

downld_img_test() -&gt;
   % create a new mock process
    M = em:new(),

    Url = test_url,

    em:strict(M, net_io, schedule_download,
              [Url,
               %% em:zelf() will match 'self()' of the process under test!
               em:zelf()]),

    em:replay(M),

    %% call code under test
    xxx_impl:download_image(Url),

    %% await the cast to happen:
    em:await_expectations(M).

</pre>

<h2> More Support for asynchronous calls </h2>

<p>Erlymock provides support for blocking the test process until a specific
expection defined by <a href="#strict-4"><code>strict/4</code></a> or <a href="#strict-5"><code>strict/5</code></a> was recorded by the
mock process.</p>

<p>Both <a href="#strict-4"><code>strict/4</code></a> and <a href="#strict-5"><code>strict/5</code></a> return a reference to the
expectation they define. The function <a href="em.html#await-2"><code>em:await/2</code></a> accepts such a
reference and blocks until the expected invokation happens.</p>

<p>A useful property of <a href="em.html#await-2"><code>em:await/2</code></a> is that it returns the pid and the
arguments of the recorded function call. This means that <a href="em.html#await-2"><code>em:await/2</code></a> can
also be used to <i>capture</i> parameters and process ids, even when the
synchronization aspect is irrelevant.</p>

<p><i>COME CODE:</i></p>

<strong>Impl</strong>
<pre>
-module(xxx).
...
op(Pid) -&gt;
  gen_server:cast(Pid, op).
...
handle_cast(op, State) -&gt;
    collab:do_it(),
    {noreply, State}.
</pre>

<strong> Test</strong>
<pre>

op_twice_test() -&gt;
  M = em:new(),

  DoneIt =
    em:strict(M, collab, do_it, []),

  em:replay(M),

  {ok, Pid} = xxx:start(),

  xxx:op(Pid),

  em:await(M, DoneIt),

  exit(Pid, kill),
  em:verify(M).

</pre>

<h2>History</h2>

<p> ErlyMock has undergone many stages and years of development and usage before
reaching this stage.</p>

<p> It was first published here:
http://sheyll.blogspot.com/2009/02/erlang-mock-erlymock.html Then Samual Rivas
cleaned it up and added support for restoring cover compiled modules for his
project, see http://www.lambdastream.com/. </p>

<p>The code was then added with all modifications to the great new
erlang-maven-plugin forge which can be found here:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/erlang-plugin/.  </p>

<p> Then I decided to partially rewrite ErlyMock in order to provide a simpler
API and in order to improve the code quality. Also, I wanted to use the gen_fsm
OTP standard behavior.</p>

<p> Later loxybjorn on github added rebar support, now erlymock could automatically be added to rebar projects.</p>

<p> Several improvements were added by Olle Törnström, who helped fixing module purging issues.</p>

<p> Finally I decided to remove maven support, and to rely totally on rebar.</p>

<strong>Thanks to all who helped with erlymock.</strong>
